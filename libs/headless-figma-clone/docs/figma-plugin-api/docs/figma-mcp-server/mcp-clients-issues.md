Known issues you might encounter when using MCP clients with the Figma MCP server and how to resolve them.

## Claude Code token limit exceeded error[​](#claude-code-token-limit-exceeded-error "Direct link to Claude Code token limit exceeded error")

**Problem:** You receive an error message like this when using Claude:

```
Error: MCP tool "get_design_context" response (351378 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000).
Please use pagination, filtering, or limit parameters to reduce the response size.
```

**Why this happens:** The response from the Figma MCP server contains more tokens than your AI assistant can handle in a single response.

**Solution:** Increase the maximum token limit by setting the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable:

1. Open your Claude Code settings
2. Navigate to the Environment Variables section
3. Add or update the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` variable with a higher value (e.g., `50000` or `100000`)
4. Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect

For detailed instructions, see the [Claude Code environment variables documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables).

## Cursor tool call failures[​](#cursor-tool-call-failures "Direct link to Cursor tool call failures")

**Problem:** MCP tool calls fail unexpectedly in Cursor

**Why this happens:** This is often due to expired or corrupted authentication tokens.

**Solution:** Clear and re-authenticate your tokens:

1. Open the Command Palette in Cursor (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Type and select "Clear All MCP Tokens"
3. Follow the prompts to re-authenticate with your accounts
4. Try your MCP tool calls again

tip

If you continue experiencing issues, try restarting Cursor completely after clearing tokens and re-authenticating.
