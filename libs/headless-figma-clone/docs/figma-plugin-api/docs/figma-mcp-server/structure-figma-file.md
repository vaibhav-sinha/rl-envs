- Figma MCP Server
- How to get the best output
- Structure your Figma file for better code

Here's how you can help provide the best context for your design intent, so the MCP and your AI assistant can generate code that's clear, consistent, and aligned with your system:

1. **Use components**

   Buttons, cards, inputs, nav items - anything repeated should be a component. This makes reuse possible (especially when paired with Code Connect) and keeps the file cleaner.
2. **Link components to real code using Code Connect**

   This is the #1 way to get consistent component reuse in code. Without it, the model is guessing.
3. **Use Figma variables for tokens**

   Apply variables for spacing, color, radius, and typography.
4. **Use clear, semantic names for layers and components**

   Replace default names (`Frame1268`, `Group5`) with intent-driven ones like `CardContainer`, `ProductImage`, or `CTA_Button`. This helps the model understand what it's working with, and what functionality it should have.
5. **Use Auto Layout**

   Make your design more responsive and communicate layout intent clearly by using Auto layout. It helps avoid absolute positioning and usually results in cleaner, more predictable code.

   note

   **Tip:** Resize the frame in Figma to check that it behaves as expected before generating code.
6. **Use annotations**

   This helps convey design intent that's hard to capture from visuals alone, like how something should behave, align, or respond.
7. **Use dev resources (coming soon)**

   Get links to developer resources that are applied to layers in Dev Mode.
