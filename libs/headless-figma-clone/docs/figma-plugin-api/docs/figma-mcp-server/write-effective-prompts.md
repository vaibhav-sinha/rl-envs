- Figma MCP Server
- How to get the best output
- Write effective prompts to guide the AI

1. The MCP gives your AI assistant structured Figma data - but what it does with that depends entirely on what you ask for.
2. **What a good prompt can do:**

   - Align the result with the right **framework or styling system**
   - Align with **your codebase conventions** (file structure, naming, layout)
   - Generate code in the correct **file path** (like `src/pages`, `components/ui`)
   - Add or modify code **inside existing files** instead of creating new ones
   - Follow specific **layout systems** (flexbox, grid, absolute)
3. **Prompt examples**

   - `Generate iOS SwiftUI code from the selected Figma frame`
   - `Implement the selected frame using Chakra UI components`
   - `Generate this using components from src/components/ui`
   - `Add this component to src/components/marketing/PricingCard.tsx`
   - `Implement this using our Stack layout component`

The more specific your prompt, the better the output. Treat it like briefing a teammate. The clearer your intent, the more likely you'll get exactly what you need.
