Shape-with-text can be used to create simple geometric shapes with embedded text. These nodes can be created using [`figma.createShapeWithText`](properties/figma-createshapewithtext.md).

## Shape with text properties[​](#shape-with-text-properties "Direct link to Shape with text properties")

### type: 'SHAPE\_WITH\_TEXT' [readonly]

Text sublayer of the ShapeWithTextNode.

---

### cornerRadius?: number [readonly]

How rounded a shape's corner is.

---

### [rotation](properties/ShapeWithTextNode-rotation.md): number

The rotation of the node in degrees. Returns values from -180 to 180. Identical to `Math.atan2(-m10, m00)` in the [`relativeTransform`](properties/nodes-relativetransform.md) matrix. When setting `rotation`, it will also set `m00`, `m01`, `m10`, `m11`.

## Geometry-related properties[​](#geometry-related-properties "Direct link to Geometry-related properties")

### [fills](properties/nodes-fills.md): ReadonlyArray<[Paint](Paint.md)> | [figma.mixed](properties/figma-mixed.md)

The paints used to fill the area of the shape. For help on how to change this value, see [Editing Properties](../editing-properties.md).

[View more →](properties/nodes-fills.md)

---

### [fillStyleId](properties/nodes-fillstyleid.md): string | [figma.mixed](properties/figma-mixed.md)

The id of the [`PaintStyle`](PaintStyle.md) object that the [`fills`](properties/nodes-fills.md) property of this node is linked to.

[View more →](properties/nodes-fillstyleid.md)

---

### setFillStyleIdAsync(styleId: string): Promise<void>

---

### setFillsAsync(paints: ReadonlyArray<[Paint](Paint.md)>): Promise<void>

Sets the fills of the node asynchronously. This is the only way to set pattern fills on a node, since we need to ensure that the source node of the pattern is loaded first. See [Adding Pattern Fills and Strokes](../adding-pattern-fills-and-strokes.md) for more information.

---

### [strokes](properties/nodes-strokes.md): ReadonlyArray<[Paint](Paint.md)>

caution

For rectangle nodes or frame-like nodes using different individual stroke weights, this property will return [`figma.mixed`](properties/figma-mixed.md).

info

For rectangle nodes or frame-like nodes, individual stroke weights can be set for each side using the following properties:

- [`strokeTopWeight`](node-properties.md#stroketopweight)

---

### setStrokesAsync(strokes: ReadonlyArray<[Paint](Paint.md)>): Promise<void>

Sets the strokes of the node asynchronously. This is the only way to set pattern strokes on a node, since we need to ensure that the source node of the pattern is loaded first. See [Adding Pattern Fills and Strokes](../adding-pattern-fills-and-strokes.md) for more information.

---

## Blend-related properties[​](#blend-related-properties "Direct link to Blend-related properties")

---

## Base node properties[​](#base-node-properties "Direct link to Base node properties")

### [id](properties/nodes-id.md): string [readonly]

The unique identifier of a node. For example, `1:3`. The node id can be used with methods such as [`figma.getNodeByIdAsync`](figma.md#getnodebyidasync), but plugins typically don't need to use this since you can usually just access a node directly.

[View more →](properties/nodes-id.md)

---

### [parent](properties/nodes-parent.md): ([BaseNode](nodes.md#base-node) & [ChildrenMixin](node-properties.md#children-mixin)) | null [readonly]

---

### [removed](properties/nodes-removed.md): boolean [readonly]

[View more →](properties/nodes-removed.md)

---

### [toString](properties/nodes-tostring.md)(): string

Returns a string representation of the node. For debugging purposes only, do not rely on the exact output of this string in production code.

[View more →](properties/nodes-remove.md)

---

### [setRelaunchData](properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata.md)(data: { [command: string]: string }): void

Sets state on the node to show a button and description when the node is selected. Clears the button and description when `relaunchData` is `{}`.

info

In Figma and Dev Mode, this shows up in the properties panel. In FigJam, this shows up in the property menu. See [here](properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata.md#example-figma-design-ui) for examples.

[View more →](properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata.md)

---

### getRelaunchData(): { [command: string]: string }

Retreives the reluanch data stored on this node using [`setRelaunchData`](properties/nodes-setrelaunchdata.md)

---

### isAsset: boolean [readonly]

Returns true if Figma detects that a node is an asset, otherwise returns false. An asset is is either an icon or a raster image.

This property is useful if you're building a [plugin for code generation](../codegen-plugins.md).

info

This property uses a set of heuristics to determine if a node is an asset. At a high level an icon is a small vector graphic and an image is a node with an image fill.

---

### getCSSAsync(): Promise<{ [key: string]: string }>

Resolves to a JSON object of CSS properties of the node. This is the same CSS that Figma shows in the inspect panel and is helpful if you are building a [plugin for code generation](../codegen-plugins.md).

---

### getTopLevelFrame(): [FrameNode](FrameNode.md) | undefined

Returns the top-most frame that contains this node. If the node is not inside a frame, this will return undefined.

info

This function will only work in Figma Design and will throw an error if called in FigJam or Slides.
