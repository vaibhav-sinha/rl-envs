A plugin for code generation needs to call `figma.codegen.on('generate')` to register a callback
that will be called when a user's selection changes in Dev Mode. This callback
should return an array of JSON objects that represent the sections in the
Inspect panel. The callback has a 15 second timeout and returns an error if it times out. For more
information, see the remarks.

## Signature[​](#signature "Direct link to Signature")

### [on](figma-codegen-on.md)(type: 'generate', callback: (event: [CodegenEvent](../CodegenEvent.md)) => Promise<[CodegenResult](../CodegenResult.md)[]> | [CodegenResult](../CodegenResult.md)[]): void

### [on](figma-codegen-on.md)(type: 'preferenceschange', callback: (event: [CodegenPreferencesEvent](../CodegenPreferencesEvent.md)) => Promise<void>): void

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

### type[​](#type "Direct link to type")

The type of event to add the callback for: 'generate' or 'preferenceschange'.

### callback[​](#callback "Direct link to callback")

The callback that is called when the event is triggered.

## Remarks[​](#remarks "Direct link to Remarks")

This callback can be async if your plugin needs to do some data fetching or other async
operation to generate code.

info

`figma.showUI` is not allowed within the generate callback. Instead, if [`figma.showUI`](figma-showui.md) is required in the generate callback, the `showUI` call should be moved outside of the callback and [`figma.ui.postMessage`](figma-ui-postmessage.md) should be used within the callback instead. This ensures that the plugin is able to handle concurrent "generate" events.

A plugin can also register a callback to handle events when codegen preferences are modified.
This is useful for codegenPreferences that need to open an iframe to get more user input.

info

Only preferences with `itemType: "action"` will trigger the `"preferenceschange"`` callback.

The callback has a 15 second timeout. If the callback registered by `figma.codegen.on('generate')`
doesn't return a value within 15 seconds (for example, if the array of JSON objects takes too long to
construct), the operation ends and an error message is sent to the console:

Callback timeout error

```
code generation timed out after 15 seconds
```

Additionally, a notification appears in the Code section of the Inspect panel to alert the
plugin's user of the error:

Inspect panel timeout error

```
<Plugin name> ran into an issue  
  
This plugin is created by a third party and not  
maintained by Figma, so to give feedback please  
reach out to the developer.
```

The error in the Inspect panel includes a link to your plugin's community page.
