On this page

Creates a `Video` object from the raw bytes of a file content. Like `Image` objects, `Video` objects **are not nodes**. They are handles to images stored by Figma. Frame backgrounds, or fills of shapes (e.g. a rectangle) may contain videos.

## Signature[​](#signature "Direct link to Signature")

### [createVideoAsync](figma-createvideoasync.md)(data: Uint8Array): Promise<[Video](../Video.md)>

## Remarks[​](#remarks "Direct link to Remarks")

The `data` passed in must be encoded as a .MP4, .MOV, or .WebM. Videos have a maximum size of 100MB. Invalid videos will throw an error.

Video can only be added to files in a paid Education, Professional, and Organization team. Plugins running on files in free Starter teams can edit existing video in a file but not upload video to it.

## Possible error cases[​](#possible-error-cases "Direct link to Possible error cases")

`Uploading videos only works in files in paid Pro teams`

`Video file type must be MP4`

`Video file must be less than 100MB`
