- ConnectorEndpoint

A connector endpoint represents one of two endpoints on a [ConnectorNode](ConnectorNode.md).

```
// attached, magneted onto edge:  
{  
  // GUID of the node this attaches to  
  endpointNodeId: string  
  
  // Which side of the node it attaches to  
  // Elbowed connectors may use all magnets besides CENTER  
  // Straight connectors may use only CENTER or NONE magnets  
  // The NONE magnet is automatically set when position is specified  
  magnet: 'NONE' | 'AUTO' | 'TOP' | 'LEFT' | 'BOTTOM' | 'RIGHT' | 'CENTER'  
} |  
  
// attached, fixed position on node:  
{  
  // GUID of the node this attaches to  
  endpointNodeId: string  
  
  // position relative to the attached node to adhere the endpoint  
  position: { x: number, y: number }  
} |  
  
// unattached, fixed to canvas:  
{  
  // location on the canvas to position unattached endpoint  
  position: { x: number, y: number }  
}
```

There's an improved way to attach [straight connectors](ConnectorNode.md#connectorlinetype) to nodes in FigJam with a new CENTER magnet. Starting in 2024, straight connectors will only be able to attach to CENTER and NONE magnets. The magnets for elbowed connectors will remain unchanged.

Attaching a straight connector endpoint to another node's CENTER magnet

```
const shape = figma.createShapeWithText()  
  
const straightConnector = figma.createConnector()  
straightConnector.connectorLineType = 'STRAIGHT'  
  
// Setting a straight connector end endpoint magnet to shape's CENTER magnet  
straightConnector.connectorEnd = {  
  endpointNodeId: shape.id,  
  magnet: 'CENTER',  
}
```
