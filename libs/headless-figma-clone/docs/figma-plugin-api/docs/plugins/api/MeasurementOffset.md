```
type MeasurementOffset =  
  | { type: 'INNER'; relative: number }  
  | { type: 'OUTER'; fixed: number }
```

The offset of a [Measurement](Measurement.md). The offset field is relative to the start node’s center. It can either be:

- type `'INNER'` where the field `relative` is between -1 and 1, indicating where along the node’s edge the measurement starts.
- type `'OUTER'` where the node field `fixed` is the space between the measurement and the edge of the start node. The sign of the number determines which side it sticks out of. Its value must be non-zero (use type `'INNER'` for an offset of `0`).
