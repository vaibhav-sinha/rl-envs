Effects can be grouped into five categories of properties: `DropShadowEffect`, `InnerShadowEffect`, `BlurEffect`, `NoiseEffect`, and `TextureEffect`. The `Effect` type is then one of the five:

```
type Effect =  
  | DropShadowEffect  
  | InnerShadowEffect  
  | BlurEffect  
  | NoiseEffect  
  | TextureEffect
```

## DropShadowEffect[​](#dropshadoweffect "Direct link to DropShadowEffect")

### type: 'DROP\_SHADOW' [readonly]

The string literal representing the type of effect this is. Always check the `type` before reading other properties.

---

### color: [RGBA](RGB.md#rgba) [readonly]

The color of the shadow, including its opacity.

---

### offset: [Vector](Vector.md) [readonly]

The offset of the shadow relative to its object. Use this property to simulate the direction of the light.

---

### radius: number [readonly]

The blur radius of the shadow. Must be >= 0. A lower radius creates a sharper shadow.

---

### spread?: number [readonly]

The distance by which to expand (or contract) the shadow. For drop shadows, a positive spread value creates a shadow larger than the node, whereas a negative value creates a shadow smaller than the node. For inner shadows, a positive `spread` value contracts the shadow. `spread` values are only accepted on rectangles and ellipses, or on frames, components, and instances with visible fill paints and `clipsContent` enabled. When left unspecified, the default value is 0.

---

### visible: boolean [readonly]

Whether this shadow is visible.

---

### blendMode: [BlendMode](BlendMode.md) [readonly]

Determines how the color of this shadow blends with the colors underneath it. The typical default value is "NORMAL".

---

### showShadowBehindNode?: boolean [readonly]

Whether the drop shadow should show behind translucent or transparent pixels within the node's geometry. Defaults to `false`.

---

### boundVariables?: { [field in [VariableBindableEffectField](VariableBindableEffectField.md)]?: [VariableAlias](VariableAlias.md)} [readonly]

The variables bound to a particular field on this shadow effect

---

## InnerShadowEffect[​](#innershadoweffect "Direct link to InnerShadowEffect")

### type: 'INNER\_SHADOW' [readonly]

The string literal representing the type of effect this is. Always check the `type` before reading other properties.

---

### color: [RGBA](RGB.md#rgba) [readonly]

The color of the shadow, including its opacity.

---

### offset: [Vector](Vector.md) [readonly]

The offset of the shadow relative to its object. Use this property to simulate the direction of the light.

---

### radius: number [readonly]

The blur radius of the shadow. Must be >= 0. A lower radius creates a sharper shadow.

---

### spread?: number [readonly]

The distance by which to expand (or contract) the shadow. For drop shadows, a positive spread value creates a shadow larger than the node, whereas a negative value creates a shadow smaller than the node. For inner shadows, a positive `spread` value contracts the shadow. `spread` values are only accepted on rectangles and ellipses, or on frames, components, and instances with visible fill paints and `clipsContent` enabled. When left unspecified, the default value is 0.

---

### visible: boolean [readonly]

Whether this shadow is visible.

---

### blendMode: [BlendMode](BlendMode.md) [readonly]

Determines how the color of this shadow blends with the colors underneath it. The typical default value is "NORMAL".

---

### boundVariables?: { [field in [VariableBindableEffectField](VariableBindableEffectField.md)]?: [VariableAlias](VariableAlias.md)} [readonly]

The variables bound to a particular field on this shadow effect

---

```

The string literal representing the type of effect this is. Always check the `type` before reading other properties.

---

### radius: number [readonly]

The radius of the blur. Must be >= 0. A lower radius creates a sharper blur. For progressive blurs, this is the end radius of the blur.

---

### visible: boolean [readonly]

Whether this blur is visible.

---

### boundVariables?: { ['radius']: [VariableAlias](VariableAlias.md) } [readonly]

The variable bound to the radius field on this blur effect

---

### BlurEffectNormal[​](#blureffectnormal "Direct link to BlurEffectNormal")

### blurType: 'NORMAL' [readonly]

The string literal representing the blur type. Always check the `blurType` before reading other properties.

---

### BlurEffectProgressive[​](#blureffectprogressive "Direct link to BlurEffectProgressive")

Progressive blur is in beta, and the API is subject to change.

### blurType: 'PROGRESSIVE' [readonly]

The string literal representing the blur type. Always check the `blurType` before reading other properties.

---

### startRadius: number [readonly]

Radius of the starting point of the progressive blur.

---

### startOffset: [Vector](Vector.md) [readonly]

Position of the starting point of the progressive blur. The position is in normalized object space (top left corner of the bounding box of the object is (0, 0) and the bottom right is (1,1)).

---

### endOffset: [Vector](Vector.md) [readonly]

Position of the ending point of the progressive blur. The position is in normalized object space (top left corner of the bounding box of the object is (0, 0) and the bottom right is (1,1)).

---
