A `TransformModifier` describes the transformations applied to the child nodes in a [TransformGroupNode](TransformGroupNode.md). Currently, only `REPEAT` modifiers are supported.

## Repeat Modifiers[​](#repeat-modifiers "Direct link to Repeat Modifiers")

There are two types of repeat modifiers: `LINEAR` and `RADIAL`. They both share the same base properties defined in the `RepeatModifier` interface.

### type: 'REPEAT'

Type of transform modifier. Currently, only 'REPEAT' is supported.

---

### count: number

Number of times to repeat the children.

---

### unitType: 'RELATIVE' | 'PIXELS'

Unit for the offset between each repetition. `RELATIVE` refers to the size of the child node, while `PIXELS` refers to an absolute pixel value.

---

### offset: number

Offset between each repetition. For `LINEAR` repeats, this is the distance between each repetition along the specified axis. For `RADIAL` repeats, this is the distance from the center of the group to the repeated nodes.

---

### Linear Repeat Modifiers[​](#linear-repeat-modifiers "Direct link to Linear Repeat Modifiers")

Linear repeat modifiers repeat child nodes along a specified axis (horizontal or vertical). The `offset` property determines the distance between each repetition.

### repeatType: 'LINEAR'

Type of repeat modifier.

---

### axis: 'HORIZONTAL' | 'VERTICAL'

Axis along which to repeat the children.

---

### Radial Repeat Modifiers[​](#radial-repeat-modifiers "Direct link to Radial Repeat Modifiers")

Radial repeat modifiers repeat child nodes in a circular pattern around a center point. The `offset` property determines the distance from the center for each repetition.

### repeatType: 'RADIAL'

Type of repeat modifier.
