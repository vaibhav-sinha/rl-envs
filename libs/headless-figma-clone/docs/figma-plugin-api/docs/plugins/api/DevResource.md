Dev Resources are a new feature of Dev Mode, which allow you to add links to any layer within Figma.

## DevResource properties[​](#devresource-properties "Direct link to DevResource properties")

### name: string [readonly]

The name of the resource.

---

### url: string [readonly]

The URL of the resource. This is considered the unique identifier of the resource.

---

### inheritedNodeId?: string [readonly]

`inheritedNodeId` is a field only relevant to links on `INSTANCE` nodes. If `inheritedNodeId` is defined, the link is inherited from a main component or a component set. If you want to edit or delete the inherited link, you will need to go to the main node to do so. For example:

```
const devResource = { ..., inheritedNodeId: '1:2' }  
const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync(devResource.inheritedNodeId)  
await node.editDevResourceAsync(...)
```

---

### nodeId: string

The ID of the node that this link is attached to.

---

## Example usage[​](#example-usage "Direct link to Example usage")

```
const node = figma.currentPage.selection[0]  
  
// Get related link  
const links = await node.getDevResourcesAsync()  
  
// Get related link from node and all of its children  
const links = await node.getDevResourcesAsync({ includeChildren: true })  
  
// Add a related link  
await node.addDevResourceAsync('https://google.com')  
  
// Edit related link  
await node.editDevResourceAsync(  
  'https://google.com', { name: 'Hotels', url: 'https://hotels.com' }  
)  
  
// Delete related link  
await node.deleteDevResourceAsync('https://hotels.com')
```
