These are methods and properties available on the `figma.textreview` global object. They are responsible for interacting with features relating to text review plugins. For a more information read our in depth guide on [text review plugins](../textreview-plugins.md).

### requestToBeEnabledAsync(): Promise<void>

This method will request your plugin to be enabled as a text review plugin for the user.
A modal will pop up that will ask the user if they want to enable the plugin for text review.
The promise returned by the function will be resolved if the user accepts in the dialog and will be rejected if the user cancels.
Note that to prevent spam the promise will be auto rejected if the user cancels the request multiple times in a given plugin run.
