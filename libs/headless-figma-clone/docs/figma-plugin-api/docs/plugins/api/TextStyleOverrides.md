```
type TextStyleOverrideType  = {  
    type: "SEMANTIC_ITALIC" | "SEMANTIC_WEIGHT" | "HYPERLINK" | "TEXT_DECORATION"  
}
```

An object describing the overrides applied on top of a text style. An array of TextStyleOverrides can be returned by [getStyledTextSegments](properties/TextNode-getstyledtextsegments.md).

- `"SEMANTIC_ITALIC"`: if the text range has a style which has been overridden to be italic.
- `"SEMANTIC_WEIGHT"`: if the text range has a style which has been overridden to be bold.
- `"HYPERLINK"`: if the text range has a style which has been overridden to have a hyperlink on it.
- `"TEXT_DECORATION"`: if the text range has a style which has been overridden to be underlined or have a strikethrough.

### Example: Text node that consumes a style with two overrides[​](#example-text-node-that-consumes-a-style-with-two-overrides "Direct link to Example: Text node that consumes a style with two overrides")

Imagine you have a Figma text node with a single textStyle, with the text "**hello** *world*".

- The font in the style is a Regular weight, and non-italicized.
- A user has bolded "hello", and italicized "world", but left the space in between untouched.

```
// Notice that the textStyleId is uniform across the selection,  
// which we can determine using either getStyledTextSegments()  
// or getRangeTextStyleId()  
  
text.getRangeTextStyleId(0, text.characters.length)  
// Output: "someStyleId" (non-mixed)  
  
text.getStyledTextSegments(['textStyleOverrides', 'textStyleId'])  
// Output:  
[  
    {  
        "characters": "hello",  
        "start": 0,  
        "end": 5,  
        "textStyleOverrides": [  
            "SEMANTIC_WEIGHT" // indicates that the font weight differs from the original style  
        ],  
        textStyleId: "someStyleId"  
    },  
    {  
        "characters": " ",  
        "start": 5,  
        "end": 6,  
        "textStyleOverrides": [], // indicates that this segment follows the original style  
        textStyleId: "someStyleId"  
    },  
    {  
        "characters": "world",  
        "start": 6,  
        "end": 11,  
        "textStyleOverrides": [  
            "SEMANTIC_ITALIC" // indicates that the italics differ from the original style  
        ],  
        textStyleId: "someStyleId"  
    }  
]  
  
// Next, to find out what was overridden, we can use getStyledTextSegments(['fontWeight', 'fontName'])  
text.getStyledTextSegments(['fontWeight', 'fontName'])  
// Output:  
[  
    {  
        "characters": "hello",  
        "start": 0,  
        "end": 5,  
        "fontName": {  
            "family": "Inter",  
            "style": "Bold"  
        },  
        "fontWeight": 700  
    },  
    {  
        "characters": " ",  
        "start": 5,  
        "end": 6,  
        "fontName": {  
            "family": "Inter",  
            "style": "Regular"  
        },  
        "fontWeight": 400  
    },  
    {  
        "characters": "world",  
        "start": 6,  
        "end": 11,  
        "fontName": {  
            "family": "Inter",  
            "style": "Italic"  
        },  
        "fontWeight": 400  
    }
