A prototyping `Trigger` describes the user input needed to cause an interaction to happen.

The `"ON_HOVER"` and `"ON_PRESS"` trigger types revert the navigation when the trigger is finished. On the other hand, `"MOUSE_ENTER"`, `"MOUSE_LEAVE"`, `"MOUSE_UP"` and `"MOUSE_DOWN"` are permanent, one-way navigation.

The `delay` parameter requires the trigger to be held for a certain duration of time before the action occurs.

Both `timeout` and `delay` are stored in milliseconds.

The `"ON_MEDIA_HIT"` and `"ON_MEDIA_END"` trigger types can only trigger from a video. They fire when a video reaches a certain time or ends. The `timestamp` parameter is stored in seconds.
