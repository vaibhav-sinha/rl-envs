In the previous section, we gave you a brief description of the comment types. The `client_meta` property of comments takes a custom Figma type, which is described below.

`Region` and `FrameOffsetRegion` represent comments that span a region. By default, the `comment_pin_corner` is in the bottom right. As an illustration, the following diagram shows how `node_offset`, `region_height`, and `region_width` interact with each other.

```
