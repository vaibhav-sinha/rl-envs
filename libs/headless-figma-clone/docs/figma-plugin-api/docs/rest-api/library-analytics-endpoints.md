On this page

There are six methods provided by the Library Analytics REST API. Components, styles, and variables each have an actions endpoint and a usages endpoint.

[GET component actions](#get-component-actions-endpoint): Get time series data about what actions your users have performed with your library's components on a week-by-week basis.

[GET component usages](#get-component-usages-endpoint): Get summary information about how many instances of a library's components exist across all files.

[GET styles actions](#get-styles-actions-endpoint): Get time series data about what actions your users have performed with your library's styles on a week-by-week basis.

[GET styles usages](#get-styles-usages-endpoint): Get summary information about how many instances of a library's styles exist across all files.

[GET variables actions](#get-variables-actions-endpoint): Get time series data about what actions your users have performed with your library's variables on a week-by-week basis.

[GET variables usages](#get-variables-usages-endpoint): Get summary information about how many instances of a library's variables exist across all files.

## GET component actions[​](#get-component-actions-endpoint "Direct link to GET component actions")

The `/v1/analytics/libraries/:library_file_key/component/actions` endpoint provides historical time series data regarding how a design system library is used. The data is returned in descending order, from most recent to least recent. Action data can be returned broken down in different ways using the required `group_by` query parameter. Data is available for up to one year.

### Types of events[​](#types-of-events "Direct link to Types of events")

We track two types of events:

- `insertions`: Tracks how many times a component in the library was inserted into a document. This can happen in many ways, including: duplicating an existing instance, copy pasting the instance from another document, or inserting the component from the asset panel.
- `detachments`: Tracks how many times a component in the library was detached.

### Data sparseness[​](#data-sparseness "Direct link to Data sparseness")

Only weeks containing data are returned. Teams and components only appear when there are associated actions.

info

This is a [Tier 3 endpoint](rate-limits.md#rate-limits-tier-table) and requires the [`library_analytics:read` scope](scopes.md).

### HTTP endpoint[​](#http-endpoint "Direct link to HTTP endpoint")

`GET /v1/analytics/libraries/:library_file_key/component/actions`

| Path parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| library\_file\_key | Stringrequired  File key of the library to fetch analytics data for. |

| Query parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| group\_by | Stringrequired  Controls how action data is organized in the response.   - `component` returns actions broken down by each component within the library. - `team` returns actions broken down by the team using the library. |
| start\_date | String  Filters the response to include time series data that occurs after the start date (inclusive). If unset, returns the prior year.  Accepts an ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DD). For example: `2023-12-03`. Dates are rounded back to the previous start of a week. For example, if you supply a Wednesday, you will get data starting on the preceding Sunday 00:00 UTC time. |
| end\_date | String  Filters the response to include time series data that that occurs before the end date (inclusive). If unset, returns up to the last full week.  Accepts an ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DD). For example: `2023-12-03`. Dates are rounded forward in time to the nearest end of a week. |
| cursor | String  Cursor for pagination. Used to retrieve the next page of data. Obtained from the response of the previous call. |

## GET component usages[​](#get-component-usages-endpoint "Direct link to GET component usages")

The `/v1/analytics/libraries/:library_file_key/component/usages` endpoint provides data on how components are used across different files and teams. This data can be broken down by component or file.

### Components and files[​](#components-and-files "Direct link to Components and files")

The endpoint can group usage by:

- `component`: Returns a list of all the components with usage in the library (unused components are excluded). The response includes the name of the component, the number of files and teams using the component, and the total number of existing instances of the component.
- `file`: Returns a list of all the files that use the library. The response includes the team name, the file name, and the total number of times that resources from the library are used. Files that you don't have access to are returned as `File not visible`. A total count of instances used in those files is also included in the response.

### Data sparseness[​](#data-sparseness-1 "Direct link to Data sparseness")
