**Important:** As of November 17, 2025 the updated rate limits are in effect. Read more in the announcement [here](../updates-to-figmas-developer-platform.md).

caution

**Note:** Figma reserves the right to change rate limits. Changes may affect specific endpoints, tiers, or plans.

Figma applies rate limits to requests to the Figma REST API to provide a consistent and reliable experience for users. Requests to the Figma REST API are limited based on three factors:

- The seat type of the user
- The rate limit tier of the endpoint
- The location and plan of the resource that the user is requesting

For example, if you use a personal access token to get the content of a file in a Starter plan, requests to that file are limited to up to 6 per month even if you have a Full seat in a different plan.

Rate limit tiers are determined based on a number of factors, including the infrastructure and cost required to support the endpoint.

Rate limits apply to both OAuth apps, plan access tokens, and personal access tokens.

- For OAuth apps, rate limits are tracked on a per-user, per-plan, per-app basis. This means that a user gets a unique rate limit budget for each app they’re using. A user’s usage of app A won’t affect their usage of app B.

  For example, Jasmine uses two apps, Figlet and Twigma. Figlet and Twigma both make requests to `GET file metadata`, a Tier 2 endpoint. Figlet frequently refreshes data so she sometimes gets rate-limited. However, because Twigma and Figlet use separate OAuth apps, Jasmine is able to use Twigma normally. Since rate limits are only applied per app, Figlet’s frequent rate-limiting issue doesn’t impact Twigma.

  David is on the same plan as Jasmine. David sometimes uses Twigma so much that his usage is rate-limited. However, because David and Jasmine have separate Figma user accounts, David’s rate-limited usage of Twigma doesn’t impact Jasmine’s usage.
- For plan access tokens, rate limits are tracked on a per-token, per-plan basis. The usage of each token is tracked separately.
- For personal access tokens, rate limits are tracked on a per-user, per-plan basis, where the user is whoever generated the token.

  For example, Mei builds a script for her team that uses `GET images`, a Tier 1 endpoint. To run the script, Mei uses a personal access token to authenticate with the REST API. When multiple people on her team are running the script at the same time, occasionally the script gets rate-limited. Because the requests are being made with Mei’s personal access token, the requests all count toward the same limit.

  note

  **Note:** Keep in mind that personal access tokens are for your whole account, not tied to specific plans in your project. This means that even though you may have a Full seat in an enterprise, enterprise-level rate limits are only applied to files residing in that plan. If you also have projects in a Starter plan, for example, requests to those files have the Starter plan rate limits applied.

The following table describes rate limits by API tier, seat, and plan. Rate limits are per-minute unless otherwise specified.

| API endpoints | Seat | Starter | Professional | Organization | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tier 1** **Files:**  ↳ [GET file](file-endpoints.md)  ↳ [GET file nodes](file-endpoints.md#get-file-nodes-endpoint)  ↳ [GET image](file-endpoints.md#get-images-endpoint) | View, Collab | Up to 6/month | Up to 6/month | Up to 6/month | Up to 6/month |
| Dev, Full | 10/min | 15/min | 20/min |
| **Tier 2** **[Comments](comments-endpoints.md)**  **[Dev Resources](dev-resources-endpoints.md)**  **[Discovery](discovery-endpoints.md)**  **Files:**  ↳ [GET image fills](file-endpoints.md#get-image-fills-endpoint)  **Projects:**  ↳ [GET team projects](projects-endpoints.md#get-team-projects-endpoint)  ↳ [GET project files](projects-endpoints.md#get-project-files-endpoint)  **Variables:**  ↳ [GET local variables](variables-endpoints.md#get-local-variables-endpoint)  ↳ [GET published variables](variables-endpoints.md#get-published-variables-endpoint)  **[Version History](version-history-endpoints.md)**  **[Webhooks](webhooks-endpoints.md)** | View, Collab | Up to 5/min | Up to 5/min | Up to 5/min | Up to 5/min |
| Dev, Full | 25/min | 50/min | 100/min |
| **Tier 3** **[Activity Logs](activity-logs-endpoints.md)**  **[Components & Styles](component-endpoints.md)**  **[Developer Logs](developer-logs-endpoints.md)**  **Files:**  ↳ [GET file metadata](file-endpoints.md#get-file-metadata-endpoint)  **[Library Analytics](library-analytics-endpoints.md)**  **[Payments](payments-endpoints.md)**  **Projects:**  ↳ [GET project metadata](projects-endpoints.md#get-project-metadata-endpoint)  **[Users](users-endpoints.md)**  **Variables:**  ↳ [POST variables](variables-endpoints.md#post-variables-endpoint) | View, Collab | Up to 10/min | Up to 10/min | Up to 10/min | Up to 10/min |
| Dev, Full | 50/min | 100/min | 150/min |

For View and Collab seats, requests are limited up to the given amount. Depending on traffic and demand, the actual limit may be lower. For example, a user with a View seat who tries to query a Tier 1 endpoint might only be able to make 2 requests in a month to get a file when traffic and demand to the REST API are high.

## How rate limiting works[​](#how-rate-limiting-works "Direct link to How rate limiting works")

For managing rate limits, Figma uses a leaky bucket algorithm. When the REST API is unable to fulfill requests due to the bucket being full or your rate limit being exceeded, the endpoint returns a `429` error.

**429 errors**

`429` errors have the following fields:

```
"Retry-After": Integer  
"X-Figma-Plan-Tier": String enum  
"X-Figma-Rate-Limit-Type": String enum  
"X-Figma-Upgrade-Link": String
```

The following table describes the fields in the error.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Retry-After` | Integer | In seconds, how long before you should retry sending the request. |
| `X-Figma-Plan-Tier` | String enum | The current plan tier of the resource the user is requesting. The value will be one of the following strings:   - `enterprise` - `org` - `pro` - `starter` - `student` |
| `X-Figma-Rate-Limit-Type` | String enum | The type of rate limit the user is encountering, based on their seat type. The value will be one of the following:   - `low` for Collab and Viewer seats - `high` for Full and Dev seats |
| `X-Figma-Upgrade-Link` | String | A link to either the `/pricing` or `/settings` pages depending on the plan/seat of the user. |

## What if my app is hitting rate limits?[​](#hitting-rate-limits "Direct link to What if my app is hitting rate limits?")

If you see your app makes requests that are getting rate-limited:

- **Review the [rate limit table](#rate-limits-tier-table) and check the tier of the rate-limited endpoint.** Also check the `X-Figma-Rate-Limit-Type` value in the [`429` error](#how-rate-limiting-works) returned when the endpoint is rate-limited. The table, endpoint tier, and rate limit type will help you identify why a given user is encountering rate limits.
- **Batch requests whenever possible.** For example, suppose you have an app that downloads images from a Figma file. Instead of sending individual requests for each image, you’d want to send a single request that includes a list of all the node ids you want to download as images.
- **Cache results.** Rather than sending frequent requests, such as a new requests whenever a part of an app’s UI is navigated to, instead cache the data from an earlier request. Then, either refresh the data when requested (such as when a user explicitly wants to refresh data in the app UI), or on a periodic basis that fits the rate limits.
- **Make sure your app is correctly [handling rate-limited requests](#handling-rate-limited-requests).** Make sure your app gracefully retries user requests after the `Retry-After` value in the `429` error.

## Handling rate-limited requests[​](#handling-rate-limited-requests "Direct link to Handling rate-limited requests")

When a request has been rate-limited, the endpoint you’re querying will start to return `429` errors. The `429` error describes why the request has been rate-limited.

The error includes a [`Retry-After` value](#429-error-table), which you can use to resend a request after the given period.

The error also includes a `X-Figma-Upgrade-Link` value, which includes a URL you can surface to users of your app. This is helpful when the demand they have for requests exceeds their current seat and plan. For example, a user with a Viewer seat on a Pro plan who wants to frequently query files may benefit from having a Full seat instead so they’re no longer limited to a maximum of 6 requests monthly to that endpoint.

**Example: Schedule and resend**

Depending on the implementation of your application, you can build logic to retry the request after the period returned in the error.

The following example demonstrates one way you could handle retrying the request.

```
const TOKEN = // <ACCESS_TOKEN>  
const FILE_KEY = // <FILE_KEY>  
  
const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms));  
  
async function exampleRetryAfter429(url, opts = {}, { maxRetries = 5 } = {}) {  
  let attempts = 0;  
  
  while (true) {  
    const res = await fetch(url, {  
      ...opts,  
      headers: { ...(opts.headers || {}), Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}` },  
    });  
  
    if (res.status !== 429) return res;  
  
    if (attempts++ >= maxRetries) {  
      throw new Error(`429 Too Many Requests after ${attempts} attempts`);  
    }  
  
    const retryAfterSec = Number(res.headers.get("retry-after")) || 1; // integer seconds  
    await sleep(retryAfterSec * 1000);  
  }  
}  
  
(async () => {  
  const url = `https://api.figma.com/v1/files/${encodeURIComponent(FILE_KEY)}`;  
  const res = await exampleRetryAfter429(url, { method: "GET" }, { maxRetries: 6 });  
  
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status} ${res.statusText}`);  
  
  console.log(JSON.stringify(await res.json(), null, 2));  
})().catch((err) => {  
  console.error(err.message || String(err));  
  process.exit(1);  
});
```

In the example, we handle the `429` error and capture the `Retry-After` value.

We also set an arbitrary number of retry attempts, 6 in the case of this example. In a practical implementation, you might prefer an approach like a backoff.

When we get the `Retry-After` value, we set a timer. When the timer expires, we then attempt to send the request again. In this way, we’re able to retry the request without manual intervention while also respecting the rate limit.

note

**Note:** The example only demonstrates handling and retrying 429 errors. The code doesn’t demonstrate a complete solution for sending requests and handling all errors.

**Example: Surface errors to a user**

For OAuth apps, depending on the way your application is built, you may want to surface errors to your users. For example, if a user is rate-limited because of the plan they’re on, you may want to surface the documentation URL that’s provided by the error.

The following example demonstrates a simple way to handle a `429` error and return the URL from `X-Figma-Upgrade-Link` to the requester.

```
const express = require("express");  
const app = express();  
  
const TOKEN = // <ACCESS_TOKEN>  
  
app.get("/api/file/:key", async (req, res) => {  
  const key = req.params.key;  
  
  const r = await fetch(`https://api.figma.com/v1/files/${encodeURIComponent(key)}`, {  
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}` },  
  });  
  
  if (r.status === 429) {  
    const upgradeUrl = r.headers.get("x-figma-upgrade-link") || null;  
    const retryAfterSec = Number(r.headers.get("retry-after")) || null;  
    return res.status(429).json({ error: "rate_limited", upgradeUrl, retryAfterSec });  
  }  
  
  if (!r.ok) {  
    return res.status(r.status).send(await r.text());  
  }  
  
  res.json(await r.json());  
});  
  
app.listen(3000, () => {});
```

For this example, let’s imagine we have a client where a user wants to get the data from a Figma file, and a server that handles making the requests and returning the responses to the user.

In the example, we send a `GET` request. Let’s assume the file key is a value provided by the user via the client. We then handle any `429` error by extracting the URL from `x-figma-upgrade-link` and sending that back to the client.

In the client, we’d then catch the incoming URL and surface it to the user. You might use an error message like: `We can't get that file right now. If you need to access files more frequently, you may need to upgrade your seat. See: <URL>`

The exact method and message you use to surface the URL to your users in a client will depend on the implementation and what information you want to share with the user.

note

**Note:** The example only demonstrates returning the URL from `X-Figma-Upgrade-Link`. The code doesn’t demonstrate comprehensive error handling or how you’d surface the URL in the client.
