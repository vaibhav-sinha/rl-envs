Figma provides a way to fetch metadata on published components and styles in a team library.

These endpoints are specifically for assets published in a team library. To get metadata for local and subscribed components and styles, use [GET /v1/files/:key](file-endpoints.md#get-files-endpoint%C3%9F).
