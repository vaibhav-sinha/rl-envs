- REST API
- Activity logs
- Events

Every event returned by the Activity Logs API contains an `actor`, an `action`, an `entity`, and a `context`.

- **Actor** is the user who performed the action. There are three attributes to identify the user: `email`, `id` and `name`. The actor field can be empty if an anonymous request triggers the event. For example: the Figma server performs a daily background job. Or, an anonymous user views a public file link. In the case of SCIM events, the `name` value is `SCIM Provider`. In the case of official support actions, the `name` value is `Figma Support`.
- **Action** is the task or activity the actor performed. The `type` tells us the kind of action, and the `details` represent the associated metadata. Each action type supports its own metadata attributes. [View supported action types and their attributes ↓](activity-logs-action-types.md)
- **Entity** is the resource the actor took the action on. It can be a user, file, project or other resource types. [View supported entity types and attributes ↓](activity-logs-entity-types.md)
- **Context** is where you can find other contextual information about the event:
  - `client_name`: The third-party application that triggered the event, if applicable.
  - `ip_address`: The IP address from of the client that sent the event request.
  - `is_figma_support_team_action`: If Figma's Support team triggered the event. This is either true or false.
  - `org_id`: The id of the organization where the event took place.
  - `team_id`: The id of the team where the event took place—if this took place in a specific team.

This example shows the event logged when an admin removes a member from the organization.
