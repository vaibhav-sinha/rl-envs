Dev Resources endpoints allow you to create, read, update, and delete dev resources in Figma files.

## GET dev resources[​](#get-dev-resources-endpoint "Direct link to GET dev resources")

Get dev resources in a file.

info

This is a [Tier 2 endpoint](rate-limits.md#rate-limits-tier-table) and requires the [`file_dev_resources:read` scope](scopes.md).

### HTTP endpoint[​](#http-endpoint "Direct link to HTTP endpoint")

`GET /v1/files/:file_key/dev_resources`

**Return value**

```
{  
  "dev_resources": DevResource[]  
}
```

| Path parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| file\_key | String  File to get dev resources from. This must be a main file key, not a branch key. |

| Query parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| node\_ids | Stringoptional  Comma separated list of nodes that you care about in the document. If specified, only dev resources attached to these nodes will be returned. If not specified, all dev resources in the file will be returned. |

| Error codes | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Invalid parameter. The `message` parameter on the response will describe the error. |
| 401 | Issue with authentication. The `message` parameter on the response will describe the error. |

## POST dev resources[​](#post-dev-resources-endpoint "Direct link to POST dev resources")

Bulk create dev resources across multiple files.

Dev resources that are successfully created will show up in the `links_created` array in the response.

If there are any dev resources that cannot be created, you may still get a 200 response. These resources will show up in the `errors` array. Some reasons a dev resource cannot be created include:

- Resource points to a `file_key` that cannot be found.
- The node already has the maximum of 10 dev resources.
- Another dev resource for the node has the same url.
