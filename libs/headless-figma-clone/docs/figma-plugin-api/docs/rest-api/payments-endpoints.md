There are two methods to query for a user's payment information on a plugin, widget, or Community file. The first method, using plugin payment tokens, is typically used when making queries from a plugin's or widget's code. The second method, providing a user ID and resource ID, is typically used when making queries from anywhere else.

Note that you can only query for resources that you own. In most cases, this means that you can only query resources that you originally created.

### Calling the Payments REST API from a plugin or widget[​](#payments-plugin-payment-token "Direct link to Calling the Payments REST API from a plugin or widget")

We offer a method in our plugin payments API that enables you to securely query for the payment status of a user of your plugin or widget. You should use this method if your plugin or widget makes a call to a server endpoint. Follow the [Getting Started guide](../plugins/requiring-payment.md#getting-started) to set up the plugin payments API in your plugin or widget.

Once you have enabled the plugin payments API in your plugin's or widget's code, you can call the [getPluginPaymentTokenAsync](../plugins/api/figma-payments.md#getpluginpaymenttokenasync) method to generate a secure plugin payment token to provide to this endpoint.

## GET payments via user and resource ID[​](#get-payments-endpoint-user-resource-id "Direct link to GET payments via user and resource ID")

Fetch the payment information of a user on your resource using IDs.

info

This is a [Tier 3 endpoint](rate-limits.md#rate-limits-tier-table).
