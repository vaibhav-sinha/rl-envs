### Filtering[​](#filtering "Direct link to Filtering")

Add filters to your request using query string parameters. You can add combinations of path parameters to create specific queries. Here are a few examples:

- Get the first 100 `org_user_create` and `org_user_delete` events from the last year

  ```
  curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?limit=100&events=org_user_create,org_user_delete'
  ```
- Get all changes made to a person’s paid status for a product

  ```
  curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?events=org_user_account_type_change'
  ```
- Get all the events between `2021-11-30 19:20:00 UTC` and `2021-12-01 23:06:40 UTC`

  ```
  curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?start_time=1638300000&end_time=1638400000'
  ```

## Pagination[​](#pagination "Direct link to Pagination")

The API sorts returned events by timestamp in ascending order by default. The max number of events the endpoint can return at a time is 1000 events. You can set a lower value using the `limit` parameter.

If the total number of events is higher than the limit, the API will paginate the response. The JSON response will contain `cursor` and `next_page: true`, fields. The cursor encodes the last event—the most recent event—in the response.

```
{  
  "error": false,  
  "i18n": null,  
  "meta": {  
    "activity_logs": [  
      …  
    ],  
    "cursor": "NjYzMDMxMjM5ODA4NjcvNDAwMDA=",  
    "next_page": true,  
  },  
  "status": 200  
}
```

To get the next batch of events, add the cursor parameter to your new query string.

```
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?cursor=NjYzMDMxMjM5ODA4NjcvNDAwMDA='
```

You'll likely poll this endpoint every few minutes to get the latest batch of events. You can append the `cursor` from the previous query to your new query. This will return any unseen events since your last query.
