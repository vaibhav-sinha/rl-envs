There are three methods provided by the Variables REST API.

[GET local variables](#get-local-variables-endpoint): Fetch the local variables created in the file and remote variables used in the file.

[GET published variables](#get-published-variables-endpoint): Fetch the variables published from this file.

[POST variables](#post-variables-endpoint): Bulk create, update, and delete local variables and variable collections.

## GET local variables[​](#get-local-variables-endpoint "Direct link to GET local variables")

**This API is available to full members of Enterprise orgs.**

The `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` endpoint lets you enumerate local variables created in the file and remote variables used in the file. Remote variables are referenced by their `subscribed_id`.

As a part of the Variables related API additions, the `GET /v1/files/:file_key` endpoint now returns a `boundVariables` property, containing the `variableId` of the bound variable. The `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` endpoint can be used to get the full variable or variable collection object.

Note that `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/published` does not return modes. Instead, you will need to use the `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` endpoint, in the same file, to examine the mode values.

info

This is a [Tier 2 endpoint](rate-limits.md#rate-limits-tier-table) and requires the [`file_variables:read` scope](scopes.md).

| Path parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| file\_key | String  File to get variables from. This can be a file key or branch key. Use `GET /v1/files/:key` with the `branch_data` query param to get the branch key. |

| Error codes | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Invalid parameter. The `message` parameter on the response will describe the error. |
| 401 | Issue with authentication. The `message` parameter on the response will describe the error. |
| 403 | API is not available. Possible error messages are `Limited by Figma plan`, `Incorrect account type`, or `Invalid scope`. This could also indicate the developer / OAuth token is invalid or expired. |

## GET published variables[​](#get-published-variables-endpoint "Direct link to GET published variables")

**This API is available to full members of Enterprise orgs.**

The `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/published` endpoint returns the variables that are published from the given file.

The response for this endpoint contains some key differences compared to the `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` endpoint:

- Each variable and variable collection contains a `subscribed_id`.
- Modes are omitted for published variable collections

Published variables have two ids: an id that is assigned in the file where it is created (`id`), and an id that is used by subscribing files (`subscribed_id`). The `id` and `key` are stable over the lifetime of the variable. The `subscribed_id` changes every time the variable is modified and published. The same is true for variable collections.

The `updatedAt` fields are ISO 8601 timestamps that indicate the last time that a change to a variable was published. For variable collections, this timestamp will change any time a variable in the collection is changed.

info

This is a [Tier 2 endpoint](rate-limits.md#rate-limits-tier-table) and requires the [`file_variables:read` scope](scopes.md).

| Path parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| file\_key | String  File to get variables from. This must be a main file key, not a branch key, as it is not possible to publish from branches. |

## POST variables[​](#post-variables-endpoint "Direct link to POST variables")

**This API is available to full members of Enterprise orgs. To call this API on a file, you must have edit access to the file.**

The `POST /v1/files/:file_key/variables` endpoint lets you bulk create, update, and delete variables and variable collections.

The request body supports the following 4 top-level arrays. Changes from these arrays will be applied in the below order, and within each array, by array order.

- `variableCollections`: For creating, updating, and deleting variable collections and creating extended collections.
- `variableModes`: For creating, updating, and deleting modes within variable collections.
  - Each collection can have a maximum of 40 modes
  - Mode names cannot be longer than 40 characters
  - Modes cannot be created or updated in extended collections. They can be deleted if the parent mode has been deleted.
- `variables`: For creating, updating, and deleting variables.
  - Each collection can have a maximum of 5000 variables
  - Variable names must be unique within a collection and cannot contain certain special characters such as `.{}`
  - Variables cannot be created in extended collections
- `variableModeValues`: For setting a variable value under a specific mode in a root collection or creating overrides in extended collections.
  - When setting aliases, a variable cannot be aliased to itself or form an alias cycle

Temporary ids can be used to reference an object later in the same `POST` request body. They can be used at create time in the `id` property of variable collections, modes, variables, and in the `initialModeId` property of variable collections. They are scoped to a single request body, and must be unique within the body. The mapping of temporary ids to real ids is returned in the response.

This endpoint has the following key behaviors:

- The request body must be 4MB or less.
- Must include an `action` property for collections, modes, and variables to tell the API whether to create, update, or delete the object.
- When creating a collection, mode, or variable, you can include a temporary `id` that can be referenced in dependent objects in the same request. For example, you can create a new collection with the id `my_new_collection`. You can then set `variableCollectionId` to `my_new_collection` in new modes or variables. Temporary ids must be unique in the request body.
- New collections always come with one mode. You can reference this mode by setting `initialModeId` to a temporary id in the request body. This is useful if you want to set values for variables in the mode in the `variableModeValues` array.
  - The `tempIdToRealId` array returns a mapping of the temporary ids in the request, to the real ids of the newly created objects.
- **Extended collections**: To create an extended collection, set `parentVariableCollectionId` to the id of the collection you want to extend. Extended collections inherit all variables and modes from the parent.
  - When creating an extended collection, you cannot use `initialModeId` (since modes are inherited from the parent). Instead, use `initialModeIdToParentModeIdMapping` to map parent mode IDs to temporary mode IDs that you can reference elsewhere in the request body.
  - Only local variable collections can be extended. Attempting to extend a remote collection will result in an error.
- **Variable overrides**: The `modeId` in `variableModeValues` determines whether you update or override a variable value:
  - Using an original mode ID (e.g., `1:0`) updates the value in the variable's root collection
  - Using an extended mode ID (e.g., `VariableCollectionId:2:5/2:0`) creates or updates an override in the specified extended collection
  - To remove an override, set the value to `null` in `variableModeValues`. This only works with extended mode IDs and will cause an error if used with an original mode ID.
- When adding new modes or variables, default variable values will be applied, consistent with what happens in the UI.
- Everything to be created, updated, and deleted in the request body is treated as one atomic operation. If there is any validation failure, you will get a 400 status code response, and no changes will be persisted.
- You will not be able to update remote variables or variable collections. You can only update variables in the file where they were originally created.

warning

**Warning:** If a string variable is bound to a text node content in the same file, and the text node uses a [shared font in the organization](https://help.figma.com/hc/articles/360039956774), that variable cannot be updated and will result in a 400 response.

The below types are accepted in the request body for this endpoint:

| Name | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| VariableCollectionChange[​](#variablecollectionchange-type "Direct link to VariableCollectionChange") An object that contains details about the desired VariableCollection change. | `action`Stringrequired  The action to perform for the variable collection, as a string enum.   - `CREATE` - `UPDATE` - `DELETE`  `id`String  Required for `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, optional for `CREATE`. This is the id of the target Variable Collection. For `CREATE`, you can provide a temporary id.  `name`String  Required for `CREATE`, optional for `UPDATE`. The name of the variable collection.  `parentVariableCollectionId`String  Optional for `CREATE`. The id of the parent variable collection to extend. When set, creates an extended collection that inherits all variables and modes from the parent. Cannot be used together with `initialModeId`. Only local variable collections can be extended.  `initialModeId`String  Optional for `CREATE`. The initial mode refers to the mode that is created by default. You can set a temporary id here, in order to reference this mode later in this request. Cannot be used when `parentVariableCollectionId` is set, as extended collections inherit modes from their parent.  `initialModeIdToParentModeIdMapping`Map<String, String>  Optional for `CREATE` when extending a collection. Maps mode IDs from the parent collection to temporary mode IDs for the new extended collection. This allows you to reference the inherited modes using temporary IDs elsewhere in the same request body. The map can be sparse and only needs to include modes you want to reference. Only valid when `parentVariableCollectionId` is set.  `hiddenFromPublishing`Boolean  Whether this variable collection is hidden when publishing the current file as a library. |
| VariableModeChange[​](#variablemodechange-type "Direct link to VariableModeChange") An object that contains details about the desired variable mode change. | `action`Stringrequired  The action to perform for the variable mode, as a string enum.   - `CREATE` - `UPDATE` - `DELETE`  `id`String  Required for `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, optional for `CREATE`. This is the id of the target variable mode. For `CREATE`, you can provide a temporary id.  `name`String  Required for `CREATE, optional for` UPDATE`. The name of the mode.  `variableCollectionId`String  Required. The variable collection that contains or will contain the mode. You can use the temporary id of a variable collection. |
| VariableChange[​](#variablechange-type "Direct link to VariableChange") An object that represents the action you want to take with a variable. | `action`Stringrequired  The action to perform for the variable, as a string enum.   - `CREATE` - `UPDATE` - `DELETE`  `id`String  Required for `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, optional for `CREATE`. This is the id of the target variable. For `CREATE`, you can provide a temporary id.  `name`String  Required for `CREATE, optional for` UPDATE`. The name of the variable.</Property> <Property name="variableCollectionId" type="String">Required for` CREATE`. The variable collection that contains or will contain the variable. You can use the temporary id of a variable collection.  `resolvedType`String  Required for `CREATE`. The resolved type of the variable, as a string enum.   - `BOOLEAN` - `FLOAT` - `STRING` - `COLOR`  `description`String  Description of this variable. Optional.  `hiddenFromPublishing`Boolean  Whether this variable is hidden when publishing the current file as a library.  `scopes`[VariableScope](variables-types.md#variablescope-type)[]  An array of scopes in the UI where this variable is shown. Setting this property will show/hide this variable in the variable picker UI for different fields.  Setting scopes for a variable does not prevent that variable from being bound in other scopes (for example, via the Plugin API). This only limits the variables that are shown in pickers within the Figma UI.  `codeSyntax`[VariableCodeSyntax](variables-types.md#variablecodesyntax-type)  Code syntax definitions for this variable. Code syntax allows you to represent variables in code using platform-specific names, and will appear in [Dev Mode](https://help.figma.com/hc/articles/15023124644247)'s code snippets when inspecting elements using the variable. |
| VariableModeValue[​](#variablemodevalue-type "Direct link to VariableModeValue") An object that represents a value for a given mode of a variable. The `modeId` determines whether this operation updates the original variable value or creates an override in an extended collection. | `variableId`Stringrequired  The target variable. You can use the temporary id of a variable.  `modeId`Stringrequired  Must correspond to a mode in the variable collection that contains the target variable or a mode in an extended collection whose root contains the target variable. The mode ID format determines the operation:   - **Original mode ID** (e.g., `1:0`): Updates the value in the variable's root collection - **Extended mode ID** (e.g., `VariableCollectionId:2:5/2:0`): Creates or updates an override in the specified extended collection  `value`Boolean | Number | String | Color | [VariableAlias](variables-types.md#variablealias-type) | nullrequired  The value for the variable. The value must match the variable's type. If setting to a variable alias, the alias must resolve to this type.  **Special behavior for extended collections**: Set to `null` to remove an override in an extended collection. The variable value will revert to the inherited value from the parent collection. Setting `null` is only valid when using an extended mode ID. Using `null` with an original mode ID will result in an error. |

  ]  
}
```

To remove an override in an extended collection:

  "variableModeValues": [  
    {  
      "variableId": "VariableID:1:3",  
      "modeId": "VariableCollectionId:2:5/1:0", // extended mode ID  
      "value": null // removes the override, falls back to parent value  
    }  
  ]  
}
```

To demonstrate the difference between updating in root vs overriding in extended collection:

```
{  
  "variableModeValues": [  
    {  
      "variableId": "VariableID:1:3",  
      "modeId": "1:0", // original mode ID updates the root collection value  
      "value": { "r": 1, "g": 1, "b": 1, "a": 1 }  
    },  
    {  
      "variableId": "VariableID:1:3",  
      "modeId": "VariableCollectionId:2:5/1:0", // extended mode ID creates override in extended collection  
      "value": { "r": 0, "g": 0, "b": 0, "a": 1 }  
    }  
  ]  
}
